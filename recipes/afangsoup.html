<h2>Description</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Afang soup; a delight to behold and to eat. It is a special delicacy of the Efik and ibibio tribes of Nigeria. Some parts of Cameroon bordering that part of Nigeria also enjoy this delicacy.</p>

<p>Afang Soup is soup is a soup rich in meats and vegetables and palm oil. If you are averse to palm oil then this soup may not be for you. Some people actually make this oil free but Noooo I can't make this soup oil free lol. Oil compliments most vegetable soups like Afang and Edikang ikong. Having tasted Afang with oil. I doubt you can convince me to ditch the oil in this recipe.</p>
