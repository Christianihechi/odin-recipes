<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Egusi is a West African name for the seeds of plants like squash, melons, and gourds that, when dried and ground become a staple ingredient in many West African dishes.  Particularly, in Nigerian culture, egusi is popular with pounded yam. These seeds are rich in fat and protein, and add these essential nutrients into West African Cuisine.

<p>Nigerian Egusi Soup is a soup thickened with ground melon seeds and contains leafy and other vegetables.  It is one of the most popular soups prepared by most tribes in Nigeria with considerable variation and often eaten with dishes like Pounded Yams.  Prepare it with goat, beef, fish, or shellfish!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>5 cups egusi (Nigerian melon) seeds</li>
<li>1.5kg assorted meat and fish:</li>
<li>Goat meat</li>
<li>Stock Fish (dry cod)</li>
<li>Ponmo (cow skin)</li>
<li>Shaki (cow tripe)</li>
<li>Red palm oil</li>
<li>3 tablespoons ground crayfish</li>
<li>Habanero pepper (to taste)</li>
<li>Bitter leaves</li>
<li>3 small stock cubes</li>
<li>1 Ogiri Okpei (traditional locust bean seasoning)</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        
        <li>When the meat and stockfish are done, remove them from the stock (water used in cooking the meat and fish) and place in a different pot or plate. Debone the stockfish and break into medium pieces.</li>
        <li>Decant the stock into a big enough pot. Add the ground crayfish and egusi to the stock and stir. If the stock from cooking your meat and fish is not enough to give you a medium consistency, add some water to get a medium consistency. See video below.</li>
        <li>Cover and start cooking on low to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Keep a close eye on it and once the egusi cakes, stir and add a little bit more water. watch it closely so that it does not burn.</li>
        <li>Repeat step 4, adding only a small quantity of water at a time. After about 20 minutes, you will notice the clear egusi oil coming to the surface of the soup.</li>
        <li>Add and bitter leaves and red palm oil, stir, cover and continue cooking for 10 more minutes, stirring it often. The soup should be yellow when ready. This shows that the red palm oil has completely integrated in the soup.</li>
        <li>Add the pepper then the cooked meat and fish. Stir and add salt only if necessary. Egusi Soup can get salty very easily.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook till it boils again then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook till it boils again then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>The egusi soup is ready to be served with Garri (Eba), Semolina Fufu, Amala, Cassava Fufu or Pounded Yam.</li>
    </ol>
